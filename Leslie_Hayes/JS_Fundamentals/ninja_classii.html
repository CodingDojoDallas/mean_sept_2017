<!--Assignment: Ninja Class II
Complete the below challenges using the Ninja Class from the previous assignment.

.punch()
Add a new method to your Ninja class called .punch(). This method will take another Ninja instance and subtract 5 Health from the Ninja we passed in. Your .punch() should display a console message like the below example.

var blue_ninja = new Ninja("Goemon");
var red_ninja = new Ninja("Bill Gates");
red_ninja.punch(blue_ninja);
// -> "Goemon was punched by Bill Gates and lost 5 Health!"
Copy
.kick()
Now add a method to your Ninja class called .kick(). Kick will subtract 15 Health for each point of Strength the calling Ninja has, and like .punch() will take another Ninja instance.

blue_ninja.kick(red_ninja);
// -> "Bill Gates was kicked by Goemon and lost 15 Health!"
Copy
Validations
Update .punch() and .kick() so that they only accept Instances of the Ninja class. Hint: You will need to find a way to check the constructor of an instance. You will often need to consult outside documentation to find solutions for particular features.-->
