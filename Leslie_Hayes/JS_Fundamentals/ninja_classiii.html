<!--Assignment: Ninja Class III
Part I
Recreate the base Ninja class from scratch using ES6 classes. Your Ninja needs the following attributes:

name
health
speed
strength
Speed and strength should be 3 by default. Health should be 100 by default.

The Ninja class should have the following methods:

sayName() - This should log that Ninja's name to the console.
showStats() - This should show the Ninja's Strength and Speed, as well as their health.
drinkSake() - This should add +10 Health to the Ninja
Part II - Sensei Class
Extend the Ninja class and create the Sensei class. A Sensei should have 200 Health, 10 speed, and 10 strength by default. In addition, a Sensei should have a new attribute called wisdom, and the default should be 10. Finally, add the speakWisdom() method. speakWisdom() should call the drinkSake() method from the Ninja class, before console.logging a wise message.

// example output
let super_sensei = new Sensei("Master Splinter");
super_sensei.speakWisdom();
// -> "What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months."
super_sensei.showStats();
// -> "Name: Master Splinter, Health: 210, Speed: 10, Strength: 10"-->
