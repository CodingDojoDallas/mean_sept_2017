Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY.  It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.

db.students.update({}, {$set: {interests: ['coding', 'brunch']}}, false, true)

Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.
Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).
Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'
